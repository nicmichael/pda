PDA - Performance Data Analyzer is a tool that helps you to analyze performance data
and troubleshoot problems by correlating data from various sources. It comes with
parsers for many common formats such as vmstat, mpstat, iostat and allows you to
easily display their data in a single graph, interactively zoom in and out, and
calculate various statistics from the data.

The pluggable parser framework allows you to implement your own parsers for your data
formats, making any of your data accessible for PDA. Parsers provide data in form of
multiple series, which each are a sequence of time-value pairs. All data that PDA
displays use time on the x-axis and values on the y-axis.
